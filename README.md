# 311-DataPipeline
This is created locally to be an open source intelligence data pipeline that connects to SeeClickFix (https://seeclickfix.com/) and downloads all the issues for a city, and then loads it in Elasticsearch.
Pipeline runs every 8 hours to actively monitor quality of life issues in neighborhoods, as well as reports of abandoned vehicles, graffiti, and needles.
